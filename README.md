## PEPR_Batteries_OpenStorm - Multimodal Battery Diagnostics

This repository is part of the **OpenStorm** project under the [PEPR Batteries](https://www.pepr-batteries.fr/projet/openstorm/) initiative, supported by the French government. Our focus lies in **multimodal machine learning** for predictive diagnostics and monitoring of batteries.

## 🔍 Project Description

**OpenStorm** aims to develop a modular and open platform for monitoring and modeling battery behavior across multiple timescales and sensing modalities. This repository contributes to the data-driven component of the project by:

- Integrating multimodal sensor data (e.g. voltage, current, dV/dt, dI/dt, temperature, imaging, acoustics)
- Designing neural models for SOH (State of Health) prediction and degradation detection
- Providing interpretable, scalable, and efficient tools for battery analytics

## 🧠 Key Components

- ✅ Multivariate time series preprocessing  
- ✅ Multimodal data fusion and synchronization  
- ✅ Deep learning (LSTM, CNN, Transformer variants)   
- ✅ Visualization of battery metrics and predictions
